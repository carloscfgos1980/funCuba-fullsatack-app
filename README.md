1. Copy files to client folder
2. Copy files to server folder
3. Make the changes in client app for the URL to match the server

**CI/CD**
.github/node.yml

I tried several scripts but I could not manage to make work "supercharge" in order to mock the databse. So I deleted test command. It works!

**Docker**
Login CLI
docker login -u carlosinfante1980

- This ask password that I have save it somewhere

- Check docker images
  docker ps

- Load the app as an image into Docker:

docker build . -t carlosinfante1980/fun-cuba

docker run -it -p:8000:8000 carlosinfante1980/fun-cuba

http://localhost:8000

It works!

- Change $ for â‚¬
- Erase "Dos Mares" from the AirData, cityDAta and the folder with the imaages. It is too expensive
- Add key={key} to the root of ChillOut.tsx and AirB.tsx so it will reload once a feedback has been post it

**ojo**
delete public folder from server before I create the docker image!!!!!
