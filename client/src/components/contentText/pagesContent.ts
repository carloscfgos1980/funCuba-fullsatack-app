  airBnBIntroI: "Fun Cuba is active in 5 cities in Cuba (Havana, Viñales, Girón, Cienfuegos and Trinidad). Nevertheless we can provide hosting in other places if the client asks for it. Cuba is not as small a country as some people would think, there is more than 800 kms distance between Havana and Santiago de Cuba and the “highway” is in very bad shape. That is the reason we focus on a sector of the Island that we consider we can provide a reliable service, and that part would be the west of the country. If some clients wanna go further, we can also help even with suggestions (free) or booking rooms in those places.",
  airBnVIntroII: "You can select the province in the field below and it will show the AirBnBs we work with, if that does not please your wishes, we could show you other choices. We strongly recommend these places coz those hosts are very nice and easy people and the houses meet all the requirements for you to fully enjoy holidays there.",
  chillingI:
    "Chill out... just chill... this is what we are good at! We have thought of a number of stuff you can do while you are in Cuba. We focus on those fun stuff that for you as a foreigner is not so easy to achieve. For that we have a super pro crew, who know their way around “the streets””. We realized who poorly managed tourism in Cuba. They focus on the beach or other natural resources. Those places are beautiful indeed and we hope you visit them when you come to the Island. But those places are not unique, you can find them anywhere else in the Caribbean. On top of that, quality-price is better in other places like Cancun and Punta Cana. Why would you go to Cuba then?",
    chillingII:"The answer is the people. Most of the agencies sell you the illusion that you can achieve that by paying a tourist package in large groups. If you want to know Cuba, you need to go out of the tourist path. It is a win-win. You as a client will enjoy a rich and unique experience and at the same time, your money will contribute to empower Cuban people. That is why we don't use any state-owned services. Everything you pay, go directly to private business which are fundamental for the dynamic of the local economy.",
